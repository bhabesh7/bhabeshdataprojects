This link desccries how we can load custom code (non specific to a model and still invoke it using same mlflow paradigms and execute it)
https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html


The below link describes the signature formats used in models
https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#model-signature-and-input-example


able to run an experiment run from git (provided MLProject is at the root). Please check the link

#This is the command to start mlflow server backed by backend sqlite3 metastore and artifacts store as local file system
mlflow server --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mydb.sqlite --default-artifact-root file:///home/bhabesh/Bhabesh/programming/python/mlflowtest/mlruns/


#similarly this is the command to start mlflow ui with backend store and defaut-artifact root. Only when you start ui with this mode
#you will see registered models
mlflow ui --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mydb.sqlite --default-artifact-root file:///home/bhabesh/Bhabesh/programming/python/mlflowtest/mlruns/
mlflow ui --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mydb.sqlite --default-artifact-root file:///home/bhabesh/Bhabesh/programming/AI/mlflow_proj/mlruns/


#command for real time serving for model
mlflow models serve -m /home/bhabesh/Bhabesh/programming/python/mlflowtest/mlruns/0/13a496f740ad4611a69fc71e0dc201a0/artifacts/model -p 1889
